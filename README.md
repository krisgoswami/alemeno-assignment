## Prerequisites
Before you can run the application, ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation
Open three separate consoles and navigate to the respective directories:

1. **Admin Panel:**
    ```bash
    cd adminPanel
    npm install
    ```

2. **Client:**
    ```bash
    cd Client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Server:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application
Once the installations are complete, start the application using the following commands:

1. **Admin Panel:**
    ```bash
    cd adminPanel
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Client:**
    ```bash
    cd Client
    npm run dev
    ```
